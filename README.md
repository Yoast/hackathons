# Hackathons

At Yoast, we have a hackathon every 6 weeks. These are full working days in which the entire development organisation will be working on a specific focus.

There are a couple of different approaches for the structure of these days:
* Pressure cooker - We create a project goal and define the tasks that need to be done; at the end of the day we want to have a working prototype
* Technological experience - Work with a framework or tool that is new or has a concept that we don't use often ourselves
* Free form exploration - Divided in teams, a goal is set for that day to explore by the teams themselves - experience is shared at the end of the day
* Workshop - Have a tutor from within (or outside of) the company guide a workshop around a specific topic

## Use of this repository

Create a branch and matching directory structure for the project you are working on.
For example; the hackathon of october 3rd:

Branch: `2019-10-03/my-teams-awesome-goal`
Directory: `2019-10-03/my-teams-awesome-goal`

At least commit the things you have at the end of the day.
